# csv-handlers-python
A group of projects in python for me to learn to handle csv files

## averages
calculates averages given a csv of numbers

## cakes
takes a csv input of cake flavours and people who like said flavour, and an input of what a flavour to search. it then outputs who would like that flavour

## dict and sort
- takes an input of clothing and types as a csv
- turns it into a dictionary
- takes an input of how to sort it by the user
- sorts them as such and outputs the sorted list

## json
- combines csv and json inputs
- takes a movie csv, and a reviews list json and handles them together
- outputs movie ratings based on the two files
